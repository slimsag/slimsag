Stephen here! I'm building [Mach engine](https://machengine.org) so that anyone can create games, visualizations, and desktop/mobile apps in Zig. The goal is to be competitive in spirit with Godot/Unity/Unreal, but more composable, data-driven & tooling oriented.

I also work at a startup called Sourcegraph [building developer tools](https://slimsag.com) for the last ~8 years. [FOSS is in my roots](https://devlog.hexops.com/2021/increasing-my-contribution-to-zig-to-200-a-month/#i-grew-up-playing-linux-games-like-mania-drive), though, and I dream of creating games and being 100% beholden to individuals. :)

Besides living two lives (full-time startup job & working on Mach ~40h/week), I care for a [small army of cats.](https://imgur.com/gallery/m6FxZ85)
