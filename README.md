## About me

At [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com) for the past 5 years I have been actively improving the lives of developers everywhere as a jack-of-all-trades.

In my spare time, I work on _[secret hush hush projects](https://github.com/hexops)_ as part of a ten-year vision to upend the gaming industry.
