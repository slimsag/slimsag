# About me

At [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com) I am actively improving the lives of developers everywhere, as a jack-of-all-trades for the past 5 years.

In my spare time, I work on _[secret hush hush projects](https://github.com/hexops)_ as part of my ten-year vision to upend the gaming industry.
